# NexMart â€“ E-Commerce Project

NexMart is a full-featured open-source e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, with plans to integrate modern frameworks in the future. It includes a responsive design, product pages, cart layout, and more.

## Features to Be Developed

- Product detail pages  
- Shopping cart functionality  
- Backend integration with PHP or Laravel  
- User login and signup system  

I also plan to add more features and improvements over time as the project evolves.
